# Cloture

Cloture is a library to let you load Clojure files as if they were Common Lisp. It is not a complete Clojure implementation; it just  automates the parts that can be easily automated. The idea is to allow Common Lisp ports of Clojure libraries to be forks, rather than complete rewrites, so future improvements can be merged from upstream.

## Why “Cloture”?

Since I primarily use the [Clozure][] implementation of Common Lisp, and I am writing a bridge to Clojure, [cloture][] seemed like a name that would lead to no confusion whatsoever.
